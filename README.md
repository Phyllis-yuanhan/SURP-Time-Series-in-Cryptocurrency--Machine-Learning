This paper investigates the forecasting of Dogecoin's closing price, distinguishing itself by employing a combination of time series analysis and machine learning techniques. Initiated as a playful counter to conventional cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has risen significantly, partly due to global events, transforming into a major digital currency. The study leverages a variety of models—ARIMA, SARIMAX, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM—to predict the closing price of Dogecoin, assessing their effectiveness through Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R²).

Through rigorous data preparation and testing, the research identifies the SVM regression model as the most accurate, achieving approximately 96.8% accuracy in out-of-sample forecasts. This model demonstrated superior predictive ability, although it suggested potential enhancements in parameter estimation could further improve outcomes.

Despite its focused approach on Dogecoin's daily closing price, the paper acknowledges limitations, including the omission of external factors like market sentiment and regulatory changes, which could affect the precision of forecasts. It suggests that future studies broaden the scope of variables considered to refine the accuracy and reliability of cryptocurrency price predictions.
